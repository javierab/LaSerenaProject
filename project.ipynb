    "Wed, Aug 19: We started looking for data about exoplanets at the exoplanet.eu catalog. When trying to figure out what data should we compare to -the not planet hosting stars- we realized this would be hard, since we can't be sure that a star doesn't hold a planet.\n",
    "We went through the Kepler project, which is trying to find planets exclusively with the transit method. They had a big catalog, labeled by confirmed planets, KOIs (Kepler's Object of Interest) and TCEs (Threshold Crossing Events). When none of this 3 were found, we could consider them as not planet hosting star (yet?).\n",

    "So far we plan to look for correlations in this data, and try to find some classification algorithm (trained with Kepler data) to see if exoplanets found with different methods have similar correlations and clusterization. We expect a positive answer!"
